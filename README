How to use:

Update the list of MAC addresses / names in macdictbuilder.py and use it to generate macs.pckl.
Assuming you're not going to be checking our router, you'll need to replace the ssh host fingerprint and hostname in presence.py.
You'll need an ssh key to connect (I highly recommend restricting it to command="wl assoclist" in your authorized_keys file), or add a password parameter to the .connect() function (not recommended).

Then: "python presence.py" should start a server on localhost:4000, or run it on your favorite WSGI enabled server.

NOTE:
if no users are found, the server returns HTTP code 204 (No Content). This often leaves browsers confused, but is great from an API perspective.
